CCCreator WASM FFmpeg README
base on FFmpeg RELEASE-3.3.9
=============

This repository hosts a customized version of FFmpeg, building upon the official FFmpeg project.
It includes the standard suite of FFmpeg libraries and tools, augmented with our proprietary
codecs and specialized audio/video processing enhancements. The original FFmpeg project
provides a comprehensive collection of libraries and tools for handling multimedia content
such as audio, video, subtitles, and related metadata.

## Custom Features

This version of FFmpeg has been enhanced with several custom features developed by our team:

*   **Proprietary Codecs:** Integration of in-house developed codecs to support specialized multimedia formats and workflows.
*   **Advanced Audio/Video Capabilities:** Introduction of new and improved audio/video processing functions, offering extended capabilities beyond the standard FFmpeg toolkit.

(Further details or links to specific documentation for these custom features can be added here.)
